\section*{Letter to the Marketing
Director}\label{letter-to-the-marketing-director}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Letter to the Marketing Director}

Dear Sunshine Company's Marketing Director:

Thanks for inviting us! We have performed an analysis based on the data
you gave. The following are our analysis results and reasons.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{You might consider push the hair dryer and pacifier to the
  market as soon as possible, but not microwave, which should be
  published later.}
\end{itemize}

Judging from the ratings, the number of five-stars in the hair dryer and
pacifier customer ratings is much higher than other stars.But the
microwave has the lowest five star rating ratio.Microwaves are
search-type products, which have high requirements on rigid technology.
Customers pay more attention to the rigid indicators of the product, and
it is more difficult to get five star rating than the other two
products.

As for time, the average score of hair dryer and pacifie has gradually
increased with the passage of time, while the average score of microwave
has gradually decreased first, reached a trough in 2012, and then
gradually recovered. In general, the market performance of microwave
ovens is not stable enough.The other types of products currently have a
good development trend, and are gradually recognized by more and more
customers.Therefore, hair dryer and pacifier should enter the market as
soon as possible and occupy market share.

But we need to more time to improve quality of microwave and find a good
time to participate.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Relationship between star rating and review date}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Please keep an eye on improving product ratings in the early
  stages of market entry.}
\end{itemize}

In the early stages of product release, customers cannot get product
information from other channels, and they are bound to pay close
attention to customer reviews. Through analysis, we found that the a
growth in the number of 4 and 5 star ratings will increase the
proportion of positive emotion words in the four categories of customer
reviews, as shown in the figure.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{CAM_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1} 

}

\caption{relationship between star rating and proportion of specific quality descriptors}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}
\end{figure}

In the structural equation modeling, we find that an increase in
positive sentiment words will significantly improve product reputation,
which indicates the future success.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Enhance specific products attributes to meet the customers
  need.}
\end{itemize}

We find out the most important words about the three types of products
through our model, indicating that customers are very concerned about
these aspects. Doing well in these aspects will greatly improve the
competitiveness of the product.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{CAM_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1} \caption{The most importent attributes in the reviews of three commodities}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-6}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from the figure that the first three concerns are as
follows:

\textbf{Hair dryer:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  brand: Customers are very concerned about the brand, so they need to
  enhance brand image and brand awareness
\item
  product part: Focus on the quality of parts and improve product
  quality
\item
  curl effect: Actively develop new technologies
\end{itemize}

\textbf{microwave:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  heating food:Provides heating modes for different foods, making it
  easy for users to heat various foods
\item
  related products :Co-organize promotional activities with
  manufacturers of related products such as refrigerators
\item
  malfunction: Improve product quality and reduce the probability of
  failure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{pacifier:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  place: Places for use of pacifiers: Customers are very concerned about
  whether pacifiers can be used by children such as newborn babies and
  teeth changing stages.
\item
  related products: Can be sold with diapers and other products
\item
  character related: Breastfeeding women pay close attention to the
  condition of pacifiers because they are about to wean their children.
  This can improve the quality of pacifiers and place advertisements in
  specific groups.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

In recent years, online shopping has become an indispensable consumption
mode in life. Online marketplaces such as Amazon have invested a
considerable amount of resources in designing and improving the store
interface, since online store interaction plays a signifificant role in
the selection process. Heijden \& Verhagen (n.d.)

Customers use online review systems to evaluate goods or services sold
by merchants. The move towards a read-write Web and the ability to
provide more relevant information to consumers on online marketplaces
has been also demonstrated to inflfluence the product choice process in
electronic markets. Godes, Ofek, \& Sarvary (n.d.)

Online review reflects the needs and preferences of customers and
influences their purchase intentions. Due to the rapid development of
online shopping, the number of online reviews has surged. How to get
useful information from online reviews to help businesses make optimal
decisions has become more and more important.For example,reviews closer
to consensus may be considered more helpful by potential consumers than
those exhibiting extremes of opinion. Sergentanis \& Economopoulos
(n.d.) Nikolaos Korfifiatis explored the qualitative or textual
characteristics of online consumer reviews. Korfiatis \& Poulos (n.d.)

This paper modeled and analyzed the variables in the review system,
clarified the relationships between the variables, and screened out
useful information, providing effective advice for Sunshine Company to
enter the market.

\hypertarget{our-work}{%
\subsection{Our work}\label{our-work}}

Explore the relationship between variables through regression models.

Use regression models to study the impact of CLI and star rating on HR.

Use the \$ TF-DIF \$ model and the customer utility function to
calculate the true utility of the customer and use the test set to check
the validity of the model.

Use a hierarchical model to predict the product's reputation trend and
find potentially successful and failing products.

Make recommendations for Sunshine Company based on the above analysis,

To establish our models, we made the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{We assume that there is no difference between customers and
  they share the same preferences for the same characteristics of the
  product.} This allows us to extract user preferences based entirely on
  the dataset. While this assumption is not entirely realistic, we
  cannot consider the educational level of customers, different age
  groups, and other factors that cause differences in customer awareness
  and understanding of products in the data provided.
\item
  \textbf{To further reduce external uncertainties, we do not consider
  the impact of changes in the market of alternative products and the
  macroeconomic cycle on these three types of commodities.} This allows
  our models to better study the characteristics of different products.
  Furthermore, this assumption simplifies our analysis and allows us to
  focus more on exploring the internal features of the dataset.
\end{itemize}

}

\caption{Relationship between star rating and helpful votes rates or total votes}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-7}
\end{figure}

From the figure 1 we can see: Because the review rating uses a discrete
scale range from1 to 5 star rating, many customers who want to express
their indifference will choose 3 star rating (middle option). For
example, when they analyzed online reviews of books on Amazon Lee,
Trimi, \& Yang (n.d.), they found that extreme ratings (1 star rating or
5 star rating) is more likely to resonate than the indifference rating
(about 3 star rating). In other words, reviews that has more emotionally
polar (only referring to either positive or negative aspects) are
considered more helpful and have a greater impact on customers. This is
also confirmed by the number of votes of each star rating. We found that
although the star ratings are not much different in recognition
(usefulness in voting), but in terms of the total number of votes, 1
star rating and 5 star rating are obviously more, which shows that
customers pay more attention to extreme reviews.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{CAM_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1} 

}

\caption{Percentage of star rating in different categories of customers}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}
\end{figure}

From the perspective of vine, vine's purchase of products after trial is
almost all 5 star ratings, while the proportion of 5 star ratings in
non-vine's are significantly lower than vine. Because customers are
invited to become Amazon Vine Voices based on the trust that they have
earned in the Amazon community for writing accurate and insightful
reviews. Therefore, the 5 star rating will be more.

\hypertarget{reviews-that-triggered-by-a-specific-star-rating}{%
\subsection{Reviews that triggered by a specific star
rating}\label{reviews-that-triggered-by-a-specific-star-rating}}

\hypertarget{research-ideas}{%
\subsubsection{Research ideas}\label{research-ideas}}

Actually, in Amazon Mall, most customers browse through the rating
results of previous customers before they comment, and then write their
own reviews.Each customer has a different feeling on the same product,
and the rating will also be different. When the customer browses the
previous reviews, it is likely to be affected by the number of ratings
of 5 levels. Therefore, we quantify this impact by the proportion of 5
ratings of all previous reviews that the customer viewed. So, how to
measure the customer's review characteristics? In the text analysis, the
emotion of the text is a commonly used text feature Ho \& E. (n.d.), so
we use the total emotion of review body to indicate customer's review
characteristics. Next, we use the function fitting to explore the
relationship between the two variables.

\hypertarget{model-construction-and-solution}{%
\subsubsection{Model construction and
solution}\label{model-construction-and-solution}}

As the model of three types of products are in exactly the same way, we
use the hair dryer as an example.

Processing \emph{star rating} results of previous customers:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Classify the products of the hair dryer.} At Amazon Mall, a
  product may be sold in different stores, and customers can only
  comment under the store where they buy a product, so we define the
  same model products sold in the same store as one type. We classify
  the products in product id.
\item
  \textbf{Screen every category of hair dryer.} There are 538 types of
  hair dryers. Since the customer who first reviewed did not have any
  previous scoring results as a reference, we first selected products
  with at least 2 reviews.
\item
  \textbf{Calculate the rating results of the \(2^{nd}\) to \(n^{th}\)
  customers browsing for each category of hair dryer.} In one category
  of hair dryer products, the \(i^{th}\) customer is the research
  object. Calculate the number and proportion of different ratings in
  \(i-1\) previous reviews.
\end{itemize}

The 1 star rating ratio is as following, and other star rating ratio
calculations are the same:

\begin{equation}
HairRate1_{i}=\frac{HairSum1_{i}}{i-1}
\end{equation}

Gao Baojun found that in a system that does not classify ratings,because
of fewer negative reviews and higher search costs, customers are more
likely to see positive reviews, so positive reviews have a greater
impact on customers.Because Amazon does not directly categorize its
ratings, and the number of 4 and 5 star ratings of hair dryer are much
higher than other ratings. At this time, searching for low star ratings
from many reviews will spent a lot of time, so the impact of high
ratings is significant. We add the 4 and 5 star rating ratio in the
customer reviews as the praise rate rate.The praise rate of the
\(i^{th}\) customer is:

\begin{equation}
rate_{i}=HairRate4_{i}+HairRate5_{i}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Then calculate the total emotion in each review of \(2^{nd}\) to
  \(n^{th}\) customers in each category.
\item
  Finally, we use function fitting to find the relationship between the
  two variables. A linear regression was carried out with R. The
  difference praise rate rate of the previous customer's rating per
  customer viewing is an independent variable and the total emotion of
  that customer's review is a dependent variable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
log(Sum_{i})=Rate_{i}+C
\end{equation}

The fitting results of the three products are shown in the
plot.\footnote{See Appendix for specific data.}

\end{table}

The trend of the total emotion changes of the three products is
different, due to the different types of products. In online shopping,
products are classified as search-type products and experiential
products. Search-type products can obtain information about quality
before using. Experiential products must be used before assessing
product quality.The impact of different product types of ratings
varies.Pacifier is an experiential product. It must be used before
evaluating product quality, so it is subjective and customers are more
likely to be affected by other customers' ratings. As the praise rate
increases, customers are significant influenced and more willing to
express their feelings about a product. Microwave is a search-type
product. Customers can accurately evaluate the quality through specific
parameters before purchasing. It is so objective that customers are not
easily affected by other customers' ratings,so it is almost a horizontal
straight line. The type of the hair dryer is between the microwave and
pacifier, so the praise rate of other customers will have a certain
impact on the total emotion of the review.Of course, the impact is lower
than that of pacifier.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Relationship between \emph{Star rating} and
specific emotion
words}{Relationship between Star rating and specific emotion words}}\label{relationship-between-star-rating-and-specific-emotion-words}}

We explored whether descriptive words of specific nature in the review
would be highly relevant to the rating. First of all, we will divide
comments into words and find the content of word segmentation . And then
we calculate the sum of joy,trust ,surprise and anticipation emotions in
each review. Furthermore, the ratio of the number of these four types of
emotional words in each review to the total number of emotional words in
that review is taken as independent variable, and the rating of each
comment is taken as dependent variable.We draw figures of three data
sets.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{CAM_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1} 

}

\caption{relationship between star rating and proportion of specific quality descriptors}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}
\end{figure}

As shown in the figure, the smooth fitting curve has a clear trend. As
the proportion of these four emotions increased, so did the rating.
These four types of emotions are positive emotions, so the more such
emotions in the reviews indicate that customers are satisfied with the
product, and ratings are higer too.

\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

We then perform linear regression on the three datasets respectively. As
we can see, since the rating is integer, the \(R^{2}\) of the model is
quite small. But the coefficients obtained by fitting are very
significant, and passed the F-test test.

\hypertarget{identify-useful-reviews}{%
\section{Identify useful reviews}\label{identify-useful-reviews}}

\hypertarget{research-ideas-1}{%
\subsection{Research ideas}\label{research-ideas-1}}

A text feature analysis of the review content is not limited to ratings
and text length. Usually when analyzing reviews, it is difficult to
analyze from the content, but we introduced CLI, total emotion, and
product keyword analysis, and conducted a full analysis about text
readability, emotional characteristics, and text keywords.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig1} 

}

\caption{Identify useful comments}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-11}
\end{figure}

There is a lot of information in the online review system of online
store, and the online store owners often want to analyze the information
in the online review system to know more about the customers and adjust
their products to promote the increase of sales volume. However, many
reviews have no impact on customers, and we call it useless evaluation.
Some reviews will have a great impact on customers, and then affect
sales volume, called useful evaluation.

Only by finding useful evaluation and analyzing it can Sunshine Company
accurately grasp customer preferences and make correct adjustment
directions in time. When new products enter the market, reviews are
published recently and need some time to be viewed by people ,so their
HRs are not accurate enough. However, in order to improve the product as
soon as possible,without knowing the accurate HR, we should find useful
comments accurately by analyzing some characteristics of the reviews. In
this way, Sunshine Company can analyze and make optimal decisions as
soon as possible.

\hypertarget{model-establishing}{%
\subsection{Model establishing}\label{model-establishing}}

In order to measure the usefulness of a review, we measure it by the
helpful votes ratio of goods :

\begin{equation}
HR=\frac{HelpfulVotes}{TotalVotes}
\end{equation}

Informativeness is a feature of reviews. We use the CLI to measure the
amount of information contained in each review and accurately measure
the information status of each review.The Coleman--Liau Index Coleman \&
Liau (n.d.) has been developed specififically for machine-based scoring.
The following formula describes the Coleman--Liau index:

\begin{equation}
CLI=5.89\times\frac{characters}{words}+\frac{sentences}{word}-15.8
\end{equation}

The CLI indicates the readability of the reviews. The smaller the CLI,
the simpler and easier to understand the review, and the higher the CLI,
the more complex the review. Combined with star ratings, through the
relationship between these variables, useful reviews can be effectively
identified to help Sunshine Company to make judgments. We assume that
CLI and rating are not simple linear relation.So we introduce quadratic
term in the regression model.

\begin{equation}
HR=\beta_{1}CLI+\beta_{2}CLI^{2}+\beta_{3}StarRating+\beta_{4}StarRating^{2}+C
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{model-result}{%

\end{longtable}

The regression results are shown in the table. The quadratic terms of
the CLI and StarRating's coefficients pass the hypothesis test and were
significantly different from 0, indicating that the CLI and StarRating
have a significant impact on HR. The absolute value of the quadratic
term coefficient of StarRating is larger than that of CLI.

With the change of StarRating, HR will change more obviously. It can
also be seen from the figure that the HR is larger at 1 and 5 star
rating and smaller at 3 star rating, so the reviews corresponding to the
1 and 5 star ratings are more likely to be useful reviews.

With the increase of the CLI, the HR increases first and then decreases.
When the review is too simple, it contains less information and the
review is not very useful.When the review contains too complicated
information, it is difficult for customers to process, which will also
reduce the usefulness of the review. But the coefficient of the
quadratic terms of the CLI is too small, the change trend is
slow.Therefore, it is only when the reviews are extremely simple or
extremely complex that they can lead to a significant decrease in the
usefulness of the reviews.

\subsubsection{Model establishing}\label{model-establishing-1}}

Suppose we have independent training samples \{(x1, y1), (x2, y2),
\ldots{}, (xn, yn)\}, y = \{0, 1\}. The probability that each observed
sample (xi, yi) occurs is:

\begin{equation}
P\left(\mathrm{y}_{i}, \mathrm{x}_{i}\right)=P\left(\mathrm{y}_{i}=1 | \mathrm{x}_{i}\right)^{y_{i}}\left(1-P\left(\mathrm{y}_{i}=1 | \mathrm{x}_{i}\right)\right)^{1-y_{i}}
\end{equation}

Then the likelihood function for our entire sample set, in which there
are n independent samples:

\begin{equation}
L(\theta)=\prod P\left(\mathrm{y}_{i}=1 | \mathrm{x}_{i}\right)^{y_{i}}\left(1-P\left(\mathrm{y}_{i}=1 | \mathrm{x}_{i}\right)\right)^{1-y_{i}}
\end{equation}

Then, the maximum likelihood function is called \textbf{cost
function}.\footnote{The key of applying maximum likelihood method is to
  find the value \(\theta\) of the coefficient that maximizes the
  likelihood function in the model.}

\hypertarget{model-solving}{%
\subsubsection{Model solving}\label{model-solving}}

The derivative of \(L(\theta)\) with respect to \(\theta\) is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial L(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i} x_{i}-\sum_{i}^{n} \frac{e^{\theta^{T} x_{i}}}{1+e^{\theta_{x_{i}}}} x_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\sigma\left(\theta^{T} x_{i}\right)\right) x_{i}
\end{equation}

For this function, we can \textbf{not} easily find the derivatives. So
we use the properties of the gradient descent method Baobin \& Yuxia
(2011) , then:

\begin{equation}
\theta^{t+1}=\theta^{t}-\alpha \frac{\partial L(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=\theta^{t}-\alpha \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\sigma\left(\theta^{T} x_{i}\right)\right) x_{j}
\end{equation}

We normalize each variable before training. Then, we set the learning
rate to be gradually decreasing for training.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial L(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i} x_{i}-\sum_{i}^{n} \frac{e^{\theta^{T} x_{i}}}{1+e^{\theta_{x_{i}}}} x_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\sigma\left(\theta^{T} x_{i}\right)\right) x_{i}

\hypertarget{neurons}{%
\paragraph{Neurons}\label{neurons}}

A neuron is the basic unit of a neural network. Chua \& Yang (1988) The
neuron first takes input and then performs some mathematical operations
before producing an output. Zhenquan \& Dongsheng (1990)

For a two-input neuron, the output steps are: First multiply the two
inputs by the weights. Add the two results and add an bias. Finally
process them through the activation function to get the output.

\begin{equation}
y = f(x1 × w1 + x2 × w2 + b)
\end{equation}

We choose the sigmoid function as the activation function of the neural
network.

\begin{equation}
S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S'(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{(1 + e^{-x})^2} = S(x)(1-S(x))
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{neural-networks}{%
\paragraph{Neural Networks}\label{neural-networks}}

Considering the limitation of the computing resources, we build a simple
neural network. It contains 2 inputs, a hidden layer with 2 neurons (h1
and h2) , and an output layer (o1) with 1 neuron. Pingfan (2005)

\hypertarget{feedforward-and-loss}{%
\paragraph{Feedforward and Loss}\label{feedforward-and-loss}}

The process of passing the input of a neuron forward to obtain the
output is called feedforward.

Before training a neural network, we need to have a standard definition
so that we can make improvements. We use the mean square error (MSE) to
define the loss:

\begin{equation}
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_{true} - y_{pred}) 
\end{equation}

We only use one sample at a time during training, so the loss function
is:

\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned} \mathrm{MSE} &=\frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^{1}\left(y_{t r u e}-y_{p r e d}\right)^{2} \\ &=\left(y_{t r u e}-y_{p r e d}\right)^{2} \\ &=\left(1-y_{p r e d}\right)^{2} \end{aligned} 
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{model-solving-1}{%

\hypertarget{training-neural-network}{%
\paragraph{Training neural network}\label{training-neural-network}}

The process of training a neural network is to minimize the loss. The
lower the loss, the better the prediction result.

Since the predicted value is calculated by a series of network weights
and biases, the loss function is actually a multivariate function
depending on multiple weights and biases:

\begin{equation}
L\left(w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, w_{4}, w_{5}, w_{6}, b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}\right)
\end{equation}

Derivative chain rule: (take w1 as an example)

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{p r e d}} * \frac{\partial y_{p r e d}}{\partial h_{1}} * \frac{\partial h_{1}}{\partial w_{1}}
\end{equation}

This system using backward calculation of partial derivatives is called
reverse conduction.

Gongpeng, Meng, \& Changyong (2018) based on convolutional neural

the loss function will be slowly decreased, thereby improving our neural
network. Take \(w_1\) as an example:

\begin{equation}
w_{1} \leftarrow w_{1}-\eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1}}
\end{equation}

\caption{research idea of tracking the real utility}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-20}
\end{figure}

Rating reflects the utility of the customer. However, rating standards
vary from person to person. For example, some people think that 3 stars
represent average satisfaction, while others think that 3 stars can
shows their strong dissatisfaction. It can be seen that customers with
different utility share the same rating based on different scoring
criteria, and the information indicated by ratings and reviews is not
completely consistent. Rating may cause deviations in the utility
measurement due to the different personal rating standards of the
customers and the discrete scale of scoring. Therefore, by establishing
a suitable model and using the information in reviews to calculate their
real utility, Sunshine Company can analyze it. Our model's principle is
to quantify the information contained in the review and return to a
score. And with the multiple regression, we can comprehensively consider
the rating standards of all customers and build a market preference
patterns. And then recalculate the corresponding score of each review.
Finally, we match score with customer rating to ensure the correctness
of our model.And the score reflect customers true attitude toward the
product.

We will first build a model that extracts product features based on
customer reviews of the product, and then build a market utility
measurement model based on the extracted features.

\hypertarget{feature-extraction}{%
\subsection{Feature extraction}\label{feature-extraction}}

In order to take into account all the factors affecting the utility in
the review, we use tf-idf model to extract the features of the review.
It's a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a
word is to a review in our dataset. And then we can extract the feature
matrix.

\(Feature\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\) can be summarized as follows:

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{tfidf}(t, d, D)=TF \cdot IDF \cdot I_{d\in nrc}
\end{equation}

Now, we will look at what each of these terms represent.

\hypertarget{calculate-tf}{%
\subsubsection{Calculate TF}\label{calculate-tf}}

\(TF\) is an abbreviation for ''Term Frequency''. \(TF\) indicates how
often \(t\) appears in \(d\). Here we assume that ``review\_body'' is
the detailed discription of ``review\_head'', thus we extract review
features only in ``review\_body''. Meanwhile, the ``review'' mentioned
in the following refers to ``review\_body'' by default.

A larger \(TF\) means more occurences of t in the review d.

\hypertarget{calculate-idf}{%
\subsubsection{Calculate IDF}\label{calculate-idf}}

\(IDF\) is the abbreviation for ''Inverse document frequency". It's a
measure of how much information the word provides in a review. We
calculate \(IDF\) as:

\begin{equation}
IDF_{i,j}=\log \frac{\left\vert D \right\vert}{\left\vert\{ j,t_i\in j \}\right\vert}
\end{equation}

\(D\) shows a set including all reviews in a data set. \(N\) indicates
the total number of reviews included by \(D\). From the formula we can
see that when a word in one review appears more often in other reviews,
\(IDF\) will become smaller, which means that the word is more common.

\(TF \cdot IDF\) measures the weight of each word in a review, so that
each reviews can be represented by a vector.

\hypertarget{illustrative-function}{%
\subsubsection{Illustrative Function}\label{illustrative-function}}

This is an illustrative function. \(I_{d\in nrc}\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
I_{d\in nrc}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    1 & , d \in nrc \\
    0 & , d \notin nre
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

\(nrc\) refers to ``NRC Emotion Lexicon''. It's a list of English words
and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear,
anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two
sentiments (negative and positive). Here we assume that sentimental
words are the key factor that affects the customer's rating, which will
help us avoid the interference of meaningless words on review features.
It makes sense because the evaluation of the product can not avoid using
the emotional words such as ``good'' or ``bad''.

In fact, as we solve our model, we find that this assumption does not
result in the component elements of the vector representing the reviews
features to be all 0, which means that all effective reviews carry at
least one word in nrc. We also verified this in the other two data sets
\emph{hair\_dryer.tsv} and \emph{microwave.tsv}

\hypertarget{construction-of-customer-utility-function}{%
\subsection{Construction of Customer Utility
Function}\label{construction-of-customer-utility-function}}

We believe that the utility of a product depends on the customer's
personal preference and the characteristics of the product. Thus, our
model for customer utility is summarized as:

\begin{equation}
u(s, c)= score (Content (s), ContentBasedProfile(c))
\end{equation}

\(Content(s)\) is a matrix describing product characteristics based on
content. That is \(Freature\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\), calculated in
the previous model. \(ContentBasedProfile(c)\) is a measure of customer
preference. Based on our customer homogeneity assumption that customer
preference patterns represents market preference partterns. So we define
the vector representing market preference as
\(Preference\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times 1}\).Customer utility can be further
expressed as:

\begin{equation}
U= Feature \cdot Preference 
\end{equation}

We consider the star rating given by customers in the data set as a
reflection of the customer's utility. The significance of this is to let
our model learn the characteristics of different ratings from reviews,
In this way, both \$ U \$ and \$ Feature \$ are known, and the
customer's customer preference , which is also referred to the market
preference, can be quantified by the least square method.

\hypertarget{model-result-1}{%
\subsection{Model Result}\label{model-result-1}}

We split the data into training and testing sets according to a 4: 1
ratio. Take ``pacifier.tsv'' as an example. Before extracting the
reviews feature, we clean the data set by dropping two rows with null
value.Then wr calculate \(Feature\) matrix .The shape of the \(Feature\)
matrix is (18937, 16413), of which there are 2366 words in \(nrc\).
Delete the rows with all 0. The shape of the matrix has not changed.
This validates our hypothesis that sentimental words vocabulary is the
key factor affecting ratings. The key words we have selected through
feature extraction are shown in the figure.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{CAM_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1} 

}

\caption{The most important words in the review of three products}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-21}
\end{figure}

Next, we use the least squares regression on the training set to obtain
the market preference, and the value of RMSE is 1.27.

To further explore the effectiveness of the model, we predict the real
utility of customers based on the characteristics of the reviews on the
test set, and calculate the matching degree of the model on the test
set. As the star rating set is considered to be a discrete variable, we
think the error is acceptable within 1 star. The matching degree is
85.35\% on test set.

In dataset \emph{hair\_dryer} and \emph{microwave}, it is also found
that the \(Feature\) matrix has no row elements that are all 0. The RMSE
of the model is 1.50 and 2.14, and the matching degrees are 85.35\% and
77.09\%, respectively.

The real utility obtained by our model is close to the ratings of most
customers, which shows that the market rating standards constructed by
this model are indeed a comprehensive processing and averaging result of
all customer rating standards, and can represent the overall rating
standards of customers. At the same time, about 20\% of customers don't
match the real utility, indicating that this customer 's rating standard
is seriously deviating from the market rating standard, and the rating
is inaccurate. It better reflects the relationship between product
characteristics and the user's real utility.

We want to measure reputation, which is difficult since it can not be

the advantage of being more clearly defifined. And then, we add another

Using factor analysis, we try to solve a problem: there are variables
that we want to measure, but we can not directly observe them, which are
called latent variables. These can typically be rather complex
variables, such as quality of life or general mental ability. Structural
equation model (SEM) is a tool that can be used to try to measure these
latent variables. We try to explain the variation in the unexplained,
latent variables (factors), using observed, correlated variables.

Measurement part: - Factor model for the endogenous variables - Factor
model for the exogenous variables

Structural part: - Model implied by theory

\hypertarget{measurement-part}{%
\subsubsection{Measurement part}\label{measurement-part}}

Factor model for the endogenous variables - y as a function of latent
variables \(\eta\) :

\(y_q = \alpha^{y}_{q1 \eta_{1}} + \alpha^{y}_{q2 \eta_{2}} + ... \alpha^{y}_{qs \eta_{s}} + \epsilon_{q}\)

Factor model for the endogenous variables - x as a function of latent
variables \(\xi\) :

\(y_q = \alpha^{x}_{p1 \xi_{1}} + \alpha^{x}_{p2 \xi_{2}} + ... \alpha^{x}_{ps \xi_{s}} + \epsilon_{p}\)

Interpretation for factor loadings - standardize V(yi) = 1 and
V(\(\eta\)) = 1, then the OLS estimator \begin{equation}
\hat{\alpha} = (Cov(y, \eta)/V(\eta)) = \rho_{y, \eta}
\end{equation} and

\begin{equation}
V(\eta) = \hat{\alpha}^2 V(\eta) + V(\eta)
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
1 = \hat{\alpha}^2 + V(\eta)
\end{equation}

\(\hat{\alpha}^2\) is the proportion of the variance of y originating
from the factor \(\eta\) and \(1-\hat{\alpha}^2\) from the error.

\hypertarget{structural-part}{%

\begin{figure}

\caption{Structrual Equation Model Outcome}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-23}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from the figure that the circle represents the factor and
the square represents the measurement index. The number on the line is
the regression coefficient. (The number is 0 because the coefficient is
small and not shown intact.) . It can be seen from the figure that the
more positive emotion words in the review, the higher the product's
reputation. The higher the customer 's true utility in the rating, the
higher the customer 's satisfaction with the product and the higher the
product 's reputation. Among the customer types, the more customers of
the vertified type indicate that many customers are willing to purchase
the product, which is a recognition of the product quality and an
increase in reduction. The decrease of positive sentiment words in the
product reviews, the decrease of customer's true utility, and the
decrease number of customers of the vertified type indicate that the
reduction of such products will gradually decrease.

\hypertarget{product-forecast}{%
\subsection{Product Forecast}\label{product-forecast}}

From the above analysis, it can be known that the CLI in each type of
product reviews, the number of positive sentiment words, the true
utility, and proportion of customers belonging to the verified category
have a significant impact on the product 's reputation .The product 's
reputation continues to increase.Have development potential. It shows
that this product has development potential and is a potential
successful product. Otherwise, it is a potential failed product.
Therefore, attention should be paid to the changes in these four
indicators. It is predicted whether the number of reviews of the product
will increase or decrease in the next year, and based on this, it is
judged whether the product's reputation is increasing or decreasing. At
the same time, we believe that products that increase in the next year
can be regarded as potential successful products, and products that
decrease in the next year can be regarded as potential failure products.
