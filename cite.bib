  pages={103-105},
 abstract={In this article, two major domestic B2C websites-JD.com and Tmall are used as research objects to compare and analyze the impact of different evaluation systems on sales. The conclusion shows that for different evaluation systems, reviews have different effects on sales. Under the classification evaluation system, the total number of reviews and positive comments have a significant positive impact on sales; the negative evaluation has a significant negative impact on sales. Under the evaluation system without classification, the sales are significantly positively affected by the total number of comments and positive comments. Impact, but the negative evaluation does not affect sales. Price is an important factor affecting sales. The total number of reviews and prices of the two websites have a significant mutual impact on sales. This article analyzes the impact of different online evaluation systems on sales. With a view to providing a reference for enterprises to improve their online evaluation system.},

 abstract={Facing the new social media context with user-generated content as the core, the impact of online reviews on consumer purchasing decisions is becoming increasingly prominent. Taking heterogeneous products as research objects, using the Scrapy crawler framework and Redis database to collect Amazon China product reviews as research samples, to explore how the attribute characteristics of online reviews affect the sales of search-type products and experience-type products, and to further develop the network word-of-mouth theory It has important research value. Studies have shown that the impact of comment extremeness and comment length is more pronounced on the sales of search-type products; the impact of the number of reviews is more pronounced on experiential products. The research results help consumers effectively identify useful review features and help e-commerce companies to build efficient online review systems.},

 abstract={This book discusses the theory and engineering applications of artificial neural networks and simulated evolutionary computing in a comprehensive and systematic way, especially in the study of theoretical and network structure selection, dynamic neural networks, Bayesian methods, and some theoretical issues in simulated evolutionary computing The discussion is more systematic and in-depth. The explanation tries to explain the physical concepts so that the reader can understand the ideas of some main methods. The second edition strengthens the contents of statistical learning theory, nuclear methods and support vector machines, flexible applications of self-organizing networks, blind signal processing, etc., and adds examples of neural network applications in bioinformatics and finance, and recent References to reflect new developments in this area. In order to facilitate the grasp of the main content, the chapter order has also been adjusted. A chapter on distribution estimation algorithms has been added to the simulation evolution calculation section.},

As the iteration progresses, the algorithm makes the learning rate Shows periodic changes. Aiming at the defect that the Relu activation function in CNN discards neurons with a negative threshold in CNN, a CNN with LeakyRelu as the activation function is designed. Experiments have verified the effectiveness of using this activation function.The experimental results show that SGD using the above-mentioned learning rate update algorithm can make the network quickly converge and improve the learning accuracy rate; the LeakyRelu activation function and the SGD using the above-mentioned learning rate update algorithm are compared. Combined to further improve the accuracy of CNN learning.},

 abstract={A novel class of information-processing systems called cellular neural networks is proposed. Like neural networks, they are large-scale nonlinear analog circuits that process signals in real time. Like cellular automata, they consist of a massive aggregate of regularly spaced circuit clones, called cells, which communicate with each other directly only through their nearest neighbors. Each cell is made of a linear capacitor, a nonlinear voltage-controlled current source, and a few resistive linear circuit elements. Cellular neural networks share the best features of both worlds: their continuous-time feature allows real-time signal processing, and their local interconnection feature makes them particularly adapted for VLSI implementation. Cellular neural networks are uniquely suited for high-speed parallel signal processing.<<ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">>},
